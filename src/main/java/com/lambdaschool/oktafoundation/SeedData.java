				"# Objective 01 - Install Python 3 on their local machine, run the interactive prompt in the terminal, and run Python files through the interpreter\n" +
				"\n" + "## Overview\n" +
				"To get started writing Python, you need to be able to use the Python interpreter. There are essentially two primary approaches:\n" +
				"\n" + "  1. Install Python on your local machine.\n" + "\n" +
				"  2. Use a website that allows you to access the Python interpreter online.\n" + "\n" +
				"Below, we will walk through how to install Python for your specific OS and refer to some preferred websites that give you access to the interpreter online.\n" +
				"\n" + "## Follow Along\n" + "\n" + "### Windows\n" + "\n" +
				"Windows machines usually do not ship with Python installed. Installing on Windows is pretty simple.\n" + "\n" +
				"  1. Download the latest Python 3 Installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (make sure you pay attention to 32-bit vs. 64-bit and select the right one for your machine).\n" +
				"  \n" +
				"  2. Run the installer and make sure you check the box that says \"Add Python 3.x to PATH\" to ensure that you place the interpreter in your execution path.\n" +
				"\n" + "### Linux\n" + "\n" +
				"Most likely, your Linux distribution already has Python installed. However, it is likely to be Python 2 and not Python 3.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"You can determine what version you have by opening a terminal and typing `python --version`. If the version shown is `Python 2.x.x`, then you want to install the latest version of Python 3.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"The procedure for installing the latest version of Python depends on which distribution of Linux you are running.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"Use [this article](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#reader-comments) to find instructions specific to your Linux distribution.\n" +
				"\n" + "### macOS / Mac OS X\n" + "\n" +
				"Current versions of macOS include a version of Python 2, but you want to be using Python 3.\n" + "\n" +
				"The best way to install Python 3 on macOS is to use the Homebrew package manager.\n" + "\n" +
				"#### Install Homebrew\n" + "\n" +
				"  1. Go to [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/) and select the Homebrew bootstrap code under \"Install Homebrew\" and copy the complete command to your clipboard.\n" +
				"  \n" + "  2. Open a terminal window, paste the Homebrew bootstrap code, and hit \"Enter.\"\n" + "  \n" +
				"  3. It may take some time to install Homebrew, so you need to wait for that process to complete before moving on.\n" +
				"\n" + "After Homebrew has finished its installation process, you then need to install Python.\n" + "\n" +
				"#### Install Python\n" + "  \n" +
				"  1. Open a terminal and run the following command brew install python3. This command will download and install the latest version of Python.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"  2. Ensure that everything was installed correctly by opening a terminal window and running the command pip3.\n" +
				"  \n" +
				"  3. If you see help text from Python's \"pip\" package manager, you have a working Python installation.\n" +
				"\n" + "\n" + "### Online Interpreters\n" + "\n" +
				"Here are a few websites that give you online access to the Python interpreter:\n" + "\n" +
				"  - [Repl.it](https://repl.it/)\n" + "  - [Trinket](https://trinket.io/)\n" +
				"  - [Python Fiddle](http://pythonfiddle.com/)\n" +

				"  - [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)\n" + "\n" + "## Challenge\n" + "\n" +

		String listComprehensions_content = // Markdown content for the list comprehensions objective
				"# Objective 11 - Use list comprehensions\n" + "\n" + "## Overview\n" +
				"List comprehensions are a potent tool. With a list comprehension, you can create a new list based on another list in a single, highly readable line.\n" +
				"\n" + "The format of a list comprehension follows this syntax:\n" + "\n" + "```python\n" +
				"[<map expression> for <name> in <sequence expression> if <filter expression>]\n" + "```\n" + "\n" +
				"## Follow Along\n" + "\n" +
				"If you are using a `for` loop to map a list onto a new list or filter an existing list, a list comprehension can be a better option.\n" +

				"Here is an example of replacing a `for` loop used to filter out odd numbers from a list with a list comprehension.\n" +
				"\n" + "```python\n" + "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n" + "even_numbers = []\n" + "\n" +

				"print(even_numbers) # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n" + "```\n" + "\n" +
				"You can also write a list comprehension that maps and filters simultaneously. Let's go back to our sentence example and only track word lengths that are greater than 2.\n" +
				"\n" + "```python\n" + "sentence = \"Every moment is a fresh beginning.\"\n" + "words = sentence.split()\n" +
				"word_lengths = []\n" + "\n" + "# Using a for loop\n" + "for word in words:\n" + "    if len(word) > 2:\n" +
